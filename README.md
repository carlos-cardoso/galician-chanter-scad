# Galician Bagpipe Chanter

OpenScad model of a Galician bagpipe chanter. 

Measurements of the chanter were kindly provided by Professor [Paulo Marinho](http://www.paulotatomarinho.pt/).

There are two .scad files: ```gaita_c.scad``` builds the chanter by blocks, ```gaita_c_2d.scad``` rotates a 2d sketch allowing for finetuning and interpolation.

The chanter model 3d-prints and plays in its current condition, but it is slightly low and needs adjustments. If you want an inexpensive but ready-to-use instrument see [https://www.ccinstruments.pt/](https://www.ccinstruments.pt/).
